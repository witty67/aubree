What i've been doing: Trying to undertand topological quantum computing, but i'm abandoning it because it is currently not practicle.

Universal gates: Hadamard, phase rotation(pi/8 gate) and cnot
	  	 Pauli x,y,z, and CNOT

Faster quantum chemistry simulation on
fault-tolerant quantum computers

Techniques: Density functional theory
polynomially tractable approximate quantum chemistry methods.


Quantum Fourier transform: Provides an estimate of an energy eigen value

Any arbitrary single-qubit gate can be produced using three distinct phase rotations and two hadamard gates


One error corrected qubit requires 1000 faulty physical qubits


Fault tolerant phase rotations

Phase kickback

Description: Approximates arbitrary phase rotation via controlled addition applied to the |y^(k)> ancilla registers
Advantages: Trivial to compile. Circuit depth is 0(log epsilon) or 0(log log epsilon)
Disadvantages: Resource costs are 2-3X higher than Fowler sequences

Solovay-Kitaev sequence:
Descrition:Approximates arbitrary rotation with a sequence of fundanmental gates
Advantages: Polynomial-time compiling algorithm. No logical ancilla states
Disadvantages: Dramatically more expensive in quantum resources than alternatives.

Fowler sequence
Description: Approximates arbitrary rotation with a sequence of fundanmental gates. Depth is 0(log e)
Advantages: Minimal-depth sequences. No logical ancilla states
Disadvantages: Sequence determination algorithms has exponential complexity and becomes infeassible for high accuracy rotations


PAR
Description: Approximates arbitrary rotation with probabilistic circuit using ancilla and measurement
Advantages: Constant average depth(four gates) for any phase rotation
Disadvatages: Require logical ancillas which must be pre-computed.
