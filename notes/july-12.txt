A Blueprint for Building a Quantum Computer
The architecture: Physical and logical clock speed, topology of interconnects, number of logical quantum bits available in the system, and details of the algorithm implementation.


The QUDOS way is not practical because reasons, so you need to figure out why it is not practical.

Error correction: Surface code


Things to be considered:
CLock speed The conversion factor from physical gate cycle to logical gate cycle

Computer engineers responsibility: Large and fast enoguh to be useful, Small and cheap enough to be built.

6 billion qubits for the main quantum state. To address some of the limitations, the QUDOs architecture was developed.

Demonstration of a small programmable quantum computer with atomic qubits

Software -> Hardware

Hadamard(H), CNOT  and Controlled phase gate and pi/8 -----> two-qubit-Ising gates (XX) and and Single-qubit rotation (R) gates -------->
Laser pulses that are pre-calculated to effect the desired operation through the Coulomb-coupled motion while disentangling the motion at the end of the gates.


Single qubit and multiqubits------> H CNOT pi/8 ----> microwave based quantum gates that use microwave radiation with static magnetic field gradient.

Computation: First initialize all qubits to state |0> using optical pumping

In the original proposals, Logical qubits were encoded in a number of physical qubits using special code word states that allsw identification and fixing of errors (occuring on single physical qubits)


The surface code requires physical qubits to be placed in a regular lattice, which can decompose into one sublattice holding data qubits and another sublattice holding measure-X(pauli x)  and measure-Z( pauli z)  qubits

The measure-z qubits perform four successive CNOT gates wih the data qubits and the the state of measure-z is detected.

cnot z data
cnot z data
cnot z data
cnot z data
measure z
The measure x qubits do the same thing exept a hadamard was perfomed before and after
h x
cnot x data

The correction can be performed in software by translating the measurement results at the end of the execution into appropriately modified values.

pi/8 are hard to implement with surface code
