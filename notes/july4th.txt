Josephson junction: A solid state device of macroscopic dimensions that has a structure in which two superconductors are weakly coupled alllowing a cooper pair support

You can create a superposition when a single photon passes through a double slit  resulting in an interference pattern or use can use a squid(superconducting quantum interference device) but there will not be a quantum superposition becasue the currents are not in a quantum state
