# Aubree: A Quantum Computing Simulator
Aubree started out as a compiler for OpenQasm that I did for a Spring 2017 24 hour hackathon. Now I am using this project as vehicle to study Quantum Computing. This project is incomplete, but you can still play around with it at https://aubree.herokuapp.com/.

Here is a list of features that I plan on implementing within the next couple of months.

### Quarter 2 roadmap (April-June 2017)

#### Tasks:

- [ ] Functional Web Front-end 
  - [x] Launch website
  - [x] Implement File Upload
  - [ ] Run Programs that are sent from the front-end
  - [ ] Implement an embedded language in JavaScript or Python
  
- [ ] Implement a Topological Computing Simulator as a back-end

- [ ] Simulate the Topological Computer using the Quantum Gate Model of Computation.

If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to file an issue or send an email (vtomole@iastate.edu).
