# Aubree: A Quantum Computing Simulator
Aubree started out as a compiler for OpenQasm that I did for a Spring 2017 24 hour hackathon. Now I am using this project as vehicle to study Quantum Computing. This Project is Incomplete, but you can still play around with it at https://aubree.herokuapp.com/.
