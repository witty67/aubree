# Double-slit experiment at home

One of the most important and easiest physics experiment is the double-slit experiment. It highlights the wave-particle duality of light, and it is seminal to quantum theory.

This was how the setup looked like.

This is how it looked like when viewing the source.

Viewing the interference pattern.

When one slit was close. It is evident that the interference pattern does not exist, just a diffraction pattern.

The best interference pattern shot that I got.
